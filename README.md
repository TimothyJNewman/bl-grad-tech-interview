# Behaviour Lab Graduate Scheme Technical Interview

Congratulations on making it to the Behaviour Lab take-home task! We know these can be long and tedious but this one is different - please spend no longer than 3-4 hours on both tasks combined and try to have fun.

There are two tasks on this repository:

- the first task folder includes ONE typical programming question that tests your ability to problem solve and it can be solved in any programming language of your choice.
- the second task folder includes TWO tasks, one of which is geared towards Back-end and the other towards Front-end. _YOU MUST ONLY COMPLETE ONE OF THE TWO TASKS IN THE FOLDER_ `task_two`. We typically use rotations in our graduate scheme, so you gain experience with all our tech teams so just choose the question you are most comfortable with.

Please fork this repository, and complete each task in it's own subfolder.

Once you've finished, submit the project to `jobs@behaviourlab.com` and `yannis@behaviourlab.com`:

- If the repo is public simply provide the URL.
- If the repo is private, please invite _yp717_ to the repository.
